# Spike-based backpropagated DCSNNs on a custom FPGA for Self-driving cars

This repository contains all my research project details pertaining to the Implementation of Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) Platform for ADAS Tasks Using Spike-Based Backpropagated Deep Convolutional Spiking Neural Networks (DCSNN)



## Overview

This repository contains:

- **src**: contains src files for the python code snippets.
- **dataset**: contains dataset images (bicycle, bus, car, motorcycle, person, truck).
- **model**: contains trained DCSNN model.
- **training_curves**: contains training curves obtained after the training.
- **manuscript.pdf**: Outlines the whole research and relevant results.
- **README.md**: README.md file.
